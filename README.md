# 13A Pro Macropad
 ![13A-Pro_Landscape](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f3c0fe4-e33d-4bd4-831a-14a361e7a4fc)
 A simple 13-keys macropad, created with the aim of maximum functionality with relatively low cost to build,
 And yes the "Pro" in the name stands for nothing, i typed it wrong, and i'm too lazy to change everything again.
# Features
 13A Pro features small and compact size to carry almost anywhere without sacrificing its functionality,
 the main downside is that the 13A Pro doesn't have a soft reset key, despite that as it's using Arduino as the MCU,
 the layout is customizable depending on needs.

Standard layout for the 13A Pro (the first layer is the top legends, where the second layer is the bottom legends)
# DISCLAIMER
 The 13A Pro macropad hasn't tested yet, so if you decide to build one, then proceed at your own risk.
